# CF 2018 Demo Code
This is a demo web site for the presentation: **Angular for CF Developers** by Josh Kutz-Flamenbaum.

Presented at Adobe ColdFusion Summit 2018.

It can be run with CommandBox.
Currently it requires a locally running SQLServer Express but you could change that in the CFAdmin.

Clone and install with `box install`

Set to run at:
http://localhost:8070/

# CF 2018 Demo Code
This is a demo web site for the Adobe ColdFusion Summit 2018 by Josh Kutz-Flamenbaum.
It can be run with CommandBox.
Currently it requires a locally running SQLServer Express but you could change that in the CFAdmin.

Clone and install with `box install`

Set to run at:
http://localhost:8070/
